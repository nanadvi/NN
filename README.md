Connectionist Architectures and Ensemble Techniques

Implementation of a fully connected neural network that has 15,360 (128*120) neurons in the input layer, 2 hidden layers consisting 5 neurons, and one output neuron. We were able to achieve best accuracy using this architecture. As we train the network on the Male images the output value converges toward 0.5 and on the Female images the values converges towards 1. The decision plane is not well distinguished enough to be full classify the set. Some inputs the values are too close to be well classified
